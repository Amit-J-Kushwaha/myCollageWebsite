        The college, managed by Charutar Vidya Mandal (CVM) introduced the non- traditional B.Sc.
         Industrial Chemistry course in June 1973. <br>

The graduates with industrial chemistry are better suited for the job requirements in the industrial environment.

As the course covers almost all aspects of chemical industry, these students are suitable for any department in chemical industry like production, quality control, product development etc.

The syllabi have been framed to cater the needs of chemical industries. Hence the faculties comprise teachers with qualifications from various branches viz. pure chemistry, chemical technology, chemical engineering, and polymer and petroleum technology.

The department maintains consistence rapport with nearby industries of relevant specialization with a view to produce readily acceptable candidates to cater to their manpower requirements.

On research front the faculty members have together more than 100 publications in various journals of national and international repute.

The department is also recognized for registering students for Ph.D. in industrial chemistry.
